## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ This is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) focused on e-Learning. 

It will help the development of a new decentralised e-Learning platform.
There are already some components under development and many others will come with the support of the community. 

The current overall design consist of 3 modules having these objectives:
- allow the sovereignty of user learning data
- fight against the monopoly of the Ed-Tech giants
- make obsolete the recertification processes
- enable the reputation of user's curricula instead of relying on the academy brand
- acknowledge the authorship of the co-created learning materials
- support the quality of the learning material and the quality of knowledge verification through a novel gamification process
- share revenue among all of the stakeholders who participated, such as: teachers, verifiers, content creators, content publishers, platform developers, etc.
- share the ownership of the platform and the contents
